Can't ctrl+delete to delete a portion of word.
Whitespace changes don't display in git diff
Changing comment color in editor:
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations":...
  doesn't change the comment character!
cmd+p and nothing should go to previous file
changing editor.selectionBackground also changes the color of the whitespace!
dragging a (unsaved?) tab to a new window *copies* the tab instead of moving it. That's absurd. It also loses word wrap settings (and what else?)
doesn't show file preview when selecting different files in quick open. Too much slower than Sublime to be feasible I guess...
can't have the same directory opened in multiple VSCode windows? Always bumps you back to the main window.
* should name untitled windows with the text of the first line like sublime
