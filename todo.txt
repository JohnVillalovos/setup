todo:
* provide a script to bootstrap a new system:
  * that you can run with curl-a-script-from-github shenanigans
  * that'll ensure homebrew and git are installed
  * that'll check out this repo and get the setup going
* record all osx system settings that you like and write code to apply them
  - like setting sublime text as the system default editor
    http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/123833/replace-text-edit-as-the-default-text-editor

    I haven't done this yet because I can't find documentation on it,
    and even though I have my default editor set to sublime text, when I
    run 'defaults read' to see all my current settings it doesn't show up
  - and setting keyboard shortcuts like mapping F12 to mission control
* save coding font to repository and ensure it's installed
* Change every reference to $HOME in your bash_profile to be the home of your login
  user, so that when you sudo you still get *your* home stuff like the path pointing
  to your $HOME/bin so you have access to 'z' and so on. Maybe $myhome = eval "~$(logname)'?

some neat items here:

* maybe change lld to be a function that notices if it takes an argument and
  does the right thing, either listing only directories that match the argument
  or listing all directories within the current directory with no argument

* add tests for symlink that ensure that something can be both a pointer and a partial

* figure out how to get pytest for python 2 and python 3 installed simultaneously

* provide a way to specify that a brew cask is installed globally
  https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/2261

* move as much as you can to be managed by homebrew casks
  - Google Chrome
  - Firefox
  - LibreOffice
  - Spotify
  - AppCleaner
  - VLC
  - coconutbattery
  - karabiner
  - grandperspective
  - sonos
  - sublime-text3

* Maybe allow profiles somehow like "work" and "home" so you don't install Sonos at work?
