todo:
* code to install/update all homebrew packages ('setup brew' or 'setup packages')
* provide a script to bootstrap a new system:
  * that you can run with curl-a-script-from-github shenanigans
  * that'll ensure homebrew and git are installed
  * that'll check out this repo and get the setup going
* record all osx system settings that you like and write code to apply them
* save coding font to repository and ensure it's installed
* see if it's possible to use argparse better so you don't need to do
  'action' and 'sub-action' shenanigans that don't provide useful help output
