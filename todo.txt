todo:
* provide a script to bootstrap a new system:
  * that you can run with curl-a-script-from-github shenanigans
  * that'll ensure homebrew and git are installed
  * that'll check out this repo and get the setup going
* record all osx system settings that you like and write code to apply them
  - like setting sublime text as the system default editor

    I haven't done this yet because I can't find documentation on it,
    and even though I have my default editor set to sublime text, when I
    run 'defaults read' to see all my current settings it doesn't show up
  - and setting keyboard shortcuts like mapping F12 to mission control
* save coding font to repository and ensure it's installed
* Upgrade shell using homebrew. Will have to programmatically add to /etc/shells
  (but only if the homebrew version doesn't already exist there) and chsh

* Change every reference to $HOME in your bash_profile to be the home of your login
  user, so that when you sudo you still get *your* home stuff like the path pointing
  to your $HOME/bin so you have access to 'z' and so on. Maybe $myhome = eval "~$(logname)'?
